### Hello there!

I basically dump here all my university labs and projects.  
But I do make sure to document them the best I can, so you might find something useful here!  

This is my university account, my main account is [rajayonin](https://github.com/rajayonin).  

Anyway, here are some stats[^disclaimer]!  
![Account overview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldcas-uc3m/github-stats/master/generated/overview.svg)
![Languages used](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ldcas-uc3m/github-stats/master/generated/languages.svg)

[^disclaimer]: There are some [excluded repositories](https://github.com/ldcas-uc3m/github-stats/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L51) and [excluded languages](https://github.com/ldcas-uc3m/github-stats/blob/master/.github/workflows/main.yml#L52) for readability's sake and in order to make a more accurate representation of my work.
